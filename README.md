Each site can have multiple pages, and each page can have multiple sections of different types (hero, about, services, etc.) with different variants.

### 5. `src/app/layout.js`

The root layout component that wraps all pages:

- **src/lib**: Utility functions and API services
  - **src/lib/api**: Services for data fetching and API calls
  - **src/lib/supabase**: Supabase related utilities

## Application Flow

1. A user visits a subdomain (e.g., `client1.example.com`)
2. The application extracts the subdomain from the request
3. `layout.js` fetches the site configuration and themes
4. `page.js` fetches the specific page data based on the subdomain and slug
5. The appropriate section components are loaded dynamically based on the page data
6. `PageContent.jsx` renders the sections with the selected theme
7. Users can interact with the site and potentially toggle between available themes

## Database Structure

The application uses a Supabase database with the following tables:
- **sites**: Stores information about each site (name, subdomain, active status)
- **site_meta**: Stores metadata for each site (title, description, SEO information)
- **site_config**: Stores configuration settings for each site
- **themes**: Stores theme information for sites
- **pages**: Stores page information for each site
- **sections**: Stores section information for each page
- **section_content**: Stores content for each section
- **section_items**: Stores items for sections that have multiple items

## Customization Capabilities

The application allows for extensive customization:
- Multiple themes per site
- Various section types with different variants
- Custom content and items for each section
- Responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes

This architecture enables a flexible, multi-tenant website builder that can serve different businesses under different subdomains, all from a single Next.js application with Supabase as the backend.
